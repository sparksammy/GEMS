# TODO
## FROM GREATEST TO LEAST PRIORITY
* Fix int2str
* Get PS/2 keyboard support working
* Convert keycodes to english characters according to standard en-US layout
* Finish up RuShell
* Fix the ugly identation at the rloadstring("welcomescreen"); and no... running clear(); twice doesn't fix it.
