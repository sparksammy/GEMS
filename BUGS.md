Here is a list of all the bugs:

1. Restart loop bug.  
When running GEMS there is a bug that causes the OS to loop.  
We do not know the origin/source of this bug but it has not been fixed yet.

2. Cannot enter command bug
When running the os (LUA VERSION) there user cannot type a command  
because there is a while loop that always resets the command bar.
