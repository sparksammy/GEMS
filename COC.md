# Sparksammy Code of Conduct 1.0
We, overall, must follow one simple rule to each other: *Stay excellent to each other.* This includes but is not limited to:
* Using welcoming behavior and language.
* Do not cuss or use bad language unless you feel strongly about a subject
  * Basically: Do not abuse bad language
* Samuel (Sparksammy) Lord can do whatever he wants.
  * This is just so that the owner (Samuel Lord) never gets kicked or banned from his own project[s].
* No sexual behavior unless approved by the other person.
  * *Hugs do not count.*
* No murderers and sexual predators that haven't done jail time yet are allowed here. Move on to another project.
* Speaking English is a requirement so everyone understands each other.
* "The only way to do great work is to love what you do." --Steve Jobs
