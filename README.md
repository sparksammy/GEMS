GEMS - GEMS is ESSENTIALLY MAYBE SPINEL
*Note: This is not Spinel, we are just trying to be better. ;)*
Note: GEMS is in *really early development*, and will probably be that way for ***quite a while.***

Seriously... You can only boot to GRUB and we are trying to fix that...

However, here are the dependencies (in ubuntu) in case you *want* to compile this

sudo apt install -y libc6-dev-i386 grub-common nasm gcc liblua5.1-0-dev liblua50-dev qemu-system-i386 grub-pc-bin lua-socket

*(Yes, we are using grub and lua. No I, Sparksammy, don't really care; the source code is in a different place afterall, so it should be compliant with our licenses. Please don't sue if it is, just fork and send a pull request to remove the offending code, and fixing the current code that relies on current libraries.)*
