GEMS - GEMS is ESSENTIALLY MAYBE SPINEL

Note: GEMS is in *really early development*, and will probably be that way for ***quite a while.***

Seriously... You can't even boot this.

However, here are the dependencies (in ubuntu) in case you *want* to compile this

sudo apt install -y libc6-dev-i386 grub-common nasm gcc

Oh and don't forget to have the lua 5.1.5 source extracted in your home folder, and to rename it to "lua."

https://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.1.5.tar.gz

*(Yes, we are using grub and lua. No I, Sparksammy, don't really care; the source code is in a different place afterall, so it should be compliant with our licenses. Please don't sue if it is, just fork and send a pull request to remove the offending code, and fixing the current code that relies on current libraries.)*
